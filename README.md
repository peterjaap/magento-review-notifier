Magento Connect Review Notifier
=================

## Introduction ##
This script was made to notify me of any new reviews of my extensions in Magento Connect. Magento doesn't send a notification if a review is added and to be sure we offer the best support we can give, we want to be notified of new reviews as soon as possible.

## Requirements ##
* PHP 5.0 or higher
* [SQLite3](http://php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite3.php) extension
* [PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) (included)

## Configuration ##
* Place the script somewhere convenient
* Edit config.php to put in your own developer name & email addresses
* Add an entry in your crontab to set up a cron that runs, for example, every morning at 8 AM
* Go go go!

## Changelog ##
* v1.0 - released first version
